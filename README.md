# Interview Prep

The purpose of this repo is to keep track of some common interview questions. Good for me to practice.

The `questions/` folder contains a flat folder structure of questions by topic, where each topic has their own markdown file.

The `demos/` folder will contain actual code, probably very small demos or snippets, that will perhaps allow me to illustrate some of the notes I am taking in the `questions/` folder.


Some topics: 

* [React](./questions/react.md)


## Tentative Topics

* Javascript
* NodeJS
* Other Javascript runtimes
* Javascript build steps / transpilation
* Typescript
* General Frontend
* Frontend Performance
* General Backend
* NodeJS Backend frameworks (Express, etc.)
* Cloud Questions
* Testing approaches
* NextJS Questions
* Microservices vs Monolithic Architecture
* RESTful conventions
* Object Oriented Programming
* Functional Programming
